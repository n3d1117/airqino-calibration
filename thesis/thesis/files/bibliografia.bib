ABSTRACT = {A low-cost air quality station has been developed for real-time monitoring of main atmospheric pollutants. Sensors for CO, CO2, NO2, O3, VOC, PM2.5 and PM10 were integrated on an Arduino Shield compatible board. As concerns PM2.5 and PM10 sensors, the station underwent a laboratory calibration and later a field validation. Laboratory calibration has been carried out at the headquarters of CNR-IBIMET in Florence (Italy) against a TSI DustTrak reference instrument. A MATLAB procedure, implementing advanced mathematical techniques to detect possible complex non-linear relationships between sensor signals and reference data, has been developed and implemented to accomplish the laboratory calibration. Field validation has been performed across a full &ldquo;heating season&rdquo; (1 November 2016 to 15 April 2017) by co-locating the station at a road site in Florence where an official fixed air quality station was in operation. Both calibration and validation processes returned fine scores, in most cases better than those achieved for similar systems in the literature. During field validation, in particular, for PM2.5 and PM10 mean biases of 0.036 and 0.598 &micro;g/m3, RMSE of 4.056 and 6.084 &micro;g/m3, and R2 of 0.909 and 0.957 were achieved, respectively. Robustness of the developed station, seamless deployed through a five and a half month outdoor campaign without registering sensor failures or drifts, is a further key point.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of low-cost air quality sensors has proliferated among non-profits and citizen scientists, due to their portability, affordability, and ease of use. Researchers are examining the sensors for their potential use in a wide range of applications, including the examination of the spatial and temporal variability of particulate matter (PM). However, few studies have quantified the performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, and reliability) of the sensors under real-world conditions. This study examined the performance of two models of PM sensors, the AirBeam and the Alphasense Optical Particle Counter (OPC-N2), over a 12-week period in the Cuyama Valley of California, where PM concentrations are impacted by wind-blown dust events and regional transport. The sensor measurements were compared with observations from two well-characterized instruments: the GRIMM 11-R optical particle counter, and the Met One beta attenuation monitor (BAM). Both sensor models demonstrated a high degree of collocated precision (R2 = 0.8–0.99), and a moderate degree of correlation against the reference instruments (R2 = 0.6–0.76). Sensor measurements were influenced by the meteorological environment and the aerosol size distribution. Quantifying the performance of sensors in real-world conditions is a requisite step to ensuring that sensors will be used in ways commensurate with their data quality.},

ABSTRACT = {There is concern regarding the heterogeneity of exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) across urban areas leading to negatively biased health effects models. New, low-cost sensors now permit continuous and simultaneous measurements to be made in multiple locations. Measurements of ambient PM were made from October to April 2015–2016 and 2016–2017 to assess the spatial and temporal variability in PM and the relative importance of traffic and wood smoke to outdoor PM concentrations in Rochester, NY, USA. In general, there was moderate spatial inhomogeneity, as indicated by multiple pairwise measures including coefficient of divergence and signed rank tests of the value distributions. Pearson correlation coefficients were often moderate (~50% of units showed correlations &gt;0.5 during the first season), indicating that there was some coherent variation across the area, likely driven by a combination of meteorological conditions (wind speed, direction, and mixed layer heights) and the concentration of PM2.5 being transported into the region. Although the accuracy of these PM sensors is limited, they are sufficiently precise relative to one another and to research grade instruments that they can be useful is assessing the spatial and temporal variations across an area and provide concentration estimates based on higher-quality central site monitoring data.},

abstract = {An integrated monitoring platform (IMP) was developed for real-time monitoring of traffic flows and related air pollution in urban areas. The IMP includes: (i) an air quality monitoring unit, integrating the “Arduino” open-source technology with low-cost and high-resolution sensors, to measure air pollutant concentrations; (ii) a traffic monitoring device, equipped with a camera sensor and a video analysis software, to detect vehicles’ counts, speed and category; (iii) a spatial data infrastructure, composed of a central GeoDatabase, a GIS engine, and a web interface, for data storage and management. The IMP was tested in Florence (Italy) by installing sensor devices at a road site where a 1-year measuring campaign was carried out. A reference meteorological station in the city centre was used to provide observations of wind speed and direction, air temperature, and relative humidity. In this work, a statistical analysis was performed to investigate the influence of local road traffic and meteorological conditions on CO, NO2 and CO2 concentrations. Two different methods were applied: a linear regression model and an artificial neural network. To investigate the role played by emissions from road traffic, the influence of all drivers by period of the year (cold vs. warm months) and day of the week (weekdays vs. weekends) was analysed. As a result, the contribution of local road traffic on pollutant concentrations proved to be lower than meteorological parameters.}
